# Portfolio
These are some of the various projects that I've been working on.

## Web development

### [Trainiary - Your digital training diary](https://trainiary.herokuapp.com) 

This is a web-based training diary where you can add workouts to a calender and see statistics over your training. Developed in Angular (Frontend) and Django (Backend) utilizing the Django REST framework. The website uses JWT token pairs for authentication and authorization.

## Game development

### [Zombie - (Work In Progress)](http://example.com/)

The game I'm working on right now. It's going to be a 2D platformer shooter with survival and crafting elements. Terrain is procedurally generated using perlin noise and the sprites are fully destructible.

Source code [here]().

### [Racing Evolved](http://example.com/)

This is a 3D racing game with controller support and splitscreen mode available. Challenge a friend! PS. Only one person that I know of has gotten three stars on the last map. 

Source code [here]().

### [Keep Exploding](http://example.com/)

This game was made during LiU Fall Game Jam 2021 which is an event where you create a game in 48 hours. In this asymmetrical coop game you play as two terrorists trying to make a bomb in a garage. One of you is the bomb expert with access to the bomb manual with instructions on how to build the most powerful bomb, but you can't look at the screen. The other one sits at the screen and has to construct the bomb with instructions from the bomb expert. WARNING: Probably lots of bugs :)

Source code [here]().

### [Tower Defence]()

This is a tower defence game made in Java. Can you protect the penguins homeland from the invasion of ferocious polar bears?

Source code [here]().
